## Getting Started

1. Go to main.ts in your nest.js project and use your mongo url
2. you can run using docker
3. if not docker, then would recommend you to use npm i --force in client

## Important
1. There was no power in my area, but honestly speaking it took me more than 1 hour cause I went through nest js docs.
2. All the basic functionality is done, but will make more updates tomorrow, so kindly take the pull.
